     <h3 >Here's  a timeline of Brandon's life:</h3>
     <br>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>1965 </strong>- Born in Oakland, California</li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1973 </strong>- Moved back to California after his father's passing and started to
         reintroduce martial arts in his life
         at 9 years old with Dan Inosanto (Bruce Lees's former student and training partner)</li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1983 </strong>- As a student he was quite rebellious which led him to leave the Chadwick high school. He also
       changed direction from training martical arts to play soccer during this period, one speculated reason for
       that is that the dojos he had to train in were filled with posters of his father which naturally bothered him.
        Including that he seemed to have a inner conflict with his identity</li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1984 </strong>- Brandon moved to New York after he earned his GED from <em>Miraleste high school</em>, in New York
        he began to study at <em>Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute</em>. He eventually went to <em>Emerson College</em> as he majored
         in theatre</li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1986 </strong>- As he'd finished his studies, he made a number of stage productions at the <em>Eric Morris
       American New Theatre</em>. This is the start of Brandon's career as he began to work as a script reader, but soon enough got to be
      starring in movies and tv series such as <em>Kung Fu, Kung Fu: The Movie, Legacy of Rage, Ohara, Laser Mission</em> and more.
     He got nominated for a Hong Kong film award for Best New Performer of the role he played in "<em>Legacy of Rage"</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>1990 </strong>- Meanwhile, Brandon meets his future fiancée, Eliza (Liza) Hutton</li>
        <br>
       <li><strong>1991 </strong>- Eliza and Brandon move in together. As he continues to work with a
         few upcoming movies, <em>(Showdown in Little Tokyo,
         Rapid Fire and Sex, Lögner och videovåld).</em></li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1992 </strong>- The couple got engaged and Brandon got the role of Eric Draven
         in <em>The Crow</em>, which would be his last movie</li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>1993 </strong>- Brandon dies at 28 years old, his death was caused by a
         fatal injury during the filming of <em>The Crow.</em> The tragic accident occured on set
         while filming the scene of Brandon's character, Eric Draven, getting brutally murdered
         by a gang of criminals. The actor Michael Massee that played as one of the gang members,
          shot at Brandon with a loaded gun of blank rounds. They had neglect to clean the pistol
          for this scene, so a fragment from the bullet from a dummy round which had previously been
          used for close-ups, flew and hit Brandon in the abdomen</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>1994 </strong>- The movie got finished with Tchad Stahelski as a stunt
          double and Jeff Cadiente as a stand-in, with the help of CGI they could replicate
          Brandond's facial features on Jeff.
           The movie is dedicated to Brandon and Eliza</li>
      </ul>

     <p><em>Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well.
       And yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really.
       How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon
       that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it?
       Perhaps four, or five times more? Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch
       the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless...</em></p>

<h4 style="color:#3D3B3B;"><em>In the picture we can see Brandon with Eliza, he recited this quote in an interview prior to his death. The quote comes
 from the <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> by Paul Bowles. This was the quote that was supposed to be on the wedding
 invitations, it is now engraved in Brandon's gravestone.</em></h4>
